# Text-editor
Firstly, we looked for different text editors available. We found nearly forty-eight of them.
Secondly,we tried to go through the source code of some popular text-editors like Sublime text and Notepad++.
Then, we visited the github reopositories of these text-editors and found out Notepad++ which is an open source text-editor has been developed with Microsoft Visual Studio and with C/C++ compilers. 
Also, there are both paid and free versions available for the text editors. The source-code for free text-editors are available online but there is no data on the paid versions of text editors.
We did brainstorming as a team and worked out our way ahead.
